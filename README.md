This is a simple timer code made using python programming and GUI tkinter that is used to set a timer for n number of second , minutes and hours which 
would ring or start a alarm for complition of that time 

However it would not be working if the code is not in execution state it will only work if the progrm is executed and is in running mode untill the time is completed
